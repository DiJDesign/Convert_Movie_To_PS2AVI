# Convert_Movie_To_PS2AVI
A simple bash script I made for linux users that want to use the SMS homebrew app on PS2 to view their movie collections or videos they have backed up.


# Usage
1) Put the script in the directory of the video you want to convert
2) Open a terminal in that location
3) Use command ./convert_to_ps2_avi.sh <input_file1> <input_file2>...
   The script can take an infinite amount of files to convert at once, just put the path to them one after the other.

# Dependencies
You must have ffmpeg installed and configured. This was created and tested on Fedora 40.

# Video Guide
TODO: I will create a video guide on how to dump your movies and convert them to the avi format using this script in the future.
